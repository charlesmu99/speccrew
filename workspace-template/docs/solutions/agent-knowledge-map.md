# Agent Knowledge Map

> This document defines the **input knowledge** and **output deliverables** required by each Agent during task execution, following two core principles: "Determinism" and "On-Demand Loading".
>
> - **Determinism**: Each Agent knows exactly where to read what, with explicit paths, no reliance on traversal or guessing
> - **On-Demand Loading**: Only load content essential for the current task, no pre-reading of full documentation

## Knowledge Sources Overview

Agent knowledge sources are organized in three layers:

| Layer | Directory | Content | Update Frequency |
|-------|-----------|---------|------------------|
| **L1 System Knowledge** | `SpecCrew-workspace/knowledge/` | Current system technology, business functions, development conventions | Low frequency, evolves with system |
| **L2 Domain Knowledge** | `SpecCrew-workspace/knowledge/domain/` | Industry standards, business terminology, QA experience | Irregular supplementation |
| **L3 Iteration Deliverables** | `SpecCrew-workspace/iterations/iXXX/` | Current iteration PRD, Solution, design documents | Produced each iteration |

## Escalation Mechanism

When downstream discovers issues, escalate and correct along the following path:

```
Test Failure
  └→ Dev Agent fixes code
       └→ If design issue → Designer Agent corrects detailed design
            └→ If solution issue → Solution Agent corrects Solution
                 └→ If requirement issue → PM Agent + user confirmation
```

**Principle**: Do not assume, do not skip levels, must trace back to the root cause.

## Manual Confirmation Nodes

| Node | Trigger Condition | Description |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| PRD Confirmation | PM Agent completes PRD draft | User confirms requirement boundaries are correct before starting Solution phase |
| Solution Confirmation | Solution Agent completes solution | User confirms overall solution (UI/API/data model) is correct before starting design phase |
| Detailed Design Confirmation | Designer Agent completes frontend/backend detailed design | User confirms design solution is correct before starting development phase |
| Launch Confirmation | Test Agent completes test report | User confirms tests pass, no pending defects before launch |
